# Agricultural Tower Extended Controls

This Factorio mod adds more circuit controls for agricultural towers, namely:

* Reads the number of fully-grown plants within the range of this agricultural tower.
* Use a circuit condition to enable/disable harvesting of plants while still allowing planting.

Both functionalities are fairly optimized, performance impact should be minimal.

The control settings of an angricultural tower provided by this mod are preserved accross copy-pasting, and in blueprints.

## Usage

Connect a circuit wire to an agricultural tower, and open its GUI.
